          <h4>My old Story</h4>
          <p>
            By education I am interpreter and translator with university master
            degree and 5 years of working experience in interpreting and
            translating French and Serbian in construction sector.{' '}

            In my previous work, I was collaborating internationally with
            engineering and management teams, defining contractual agreements,
            negotiating business conditions and taking part in everyday problem
            solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            My job was very dynamic, involved a lot of travel and required
            staying for days or even weeks on another continent.

          <h4>My new Story</h4>
          <p>
            After bringing a family decision to move to Austria, I decided to
            start a new career in IT sector, hoping that my interest in web
            development could help me to make this transition. About 2 years ago
            I began learning and now I have certain level of understanding of
            some of the most relevant web technologies. I have built several
            projects, most of them in front-end, and two full stack applications
            since I am interested in back-end as well.
          </p>
          <Link to='/projects'>
            <button>See projects</button>
          </Link>
          <p>
            My current tool-set includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React
            and Next.js framework, Node.js and Express.js framework and MongoDB.
            I am currently focused on getting better in MERN Stack, but picking
            up a new framework or language would not be a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I really love to work with and I am especially interested in is

          <h1>How can I be useful?</h1>
          <p>
            I believe that I could be most productive performing in entry level
            positions that might be available. That could offer me a chance to
            progress, which is very important for me at this moment.

            Being a part of the team would certainly help me a lot to gain new
            perspectives and I am ready to do my best to fit in very quickly,
            promised.ðŸ˜‰
